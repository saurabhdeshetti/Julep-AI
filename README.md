# Foodie Tour Workflow – Julep AI Assignment

## Overview

This workflow takes a list of cities and, for each city, creates a personalized one-day “foodie tour.”  
It checks the weather, suggests whether to dine indoors or outdoors, picks three iconic local dishes, finds top-rated restaurants for those dishes, and crafts a fun breakfast, lunch, and dinner plan—complete with engaging narratives that factor in the weather.

---

## What Does This Workflow Do?

- **Weather Check:** For each city, it checks today’s weather and recommends indoor or outdoor dining.
- **Local Dishes:** Identifies three must-try iconic dishes unique to each city.
- **Top Restaurants:** Suggests top-rated restaurants where you can enjoy these dishes.
- **Foodie Tour Narrative:** Crafts a one-day foodie tour (breakfast, lunch, dinner) with a friendly story, assigning each meal to a dish and restaurant, and weaving in weather-based suggestions.

## How Does It Work?

1. **Input:**  
   - The user provides a list of cities (e.g., Mumbai, Paris, Tokyo).

2. **Prompt Step:**  
   - The workflow uses a single prompt step to instruct the AI to:
     - For each city, check the weather and suggest indoor or outdoor dining.
     - List three iconic local dishes.
     - Find top-rated restaurants for each dish.
     - Create a one-day foodie tour, matching each dish to a meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner) and writing a fun, engaging narrative that considers the weather.

3. **Output:**  
   - The AI returns a detailed foodie tour for each city, including weather info, meal recommendations, restaurant names, and narrative descriptions.

## Creative Touches

- **Weather-Driven Dining:** The tour narrative adapts meal settings (indoor/outdoor) based on real-time weather, making the experience more authentic.
- **Engaging Narratives:** Each meal comes with a short, inviting story—making the tour feel like a local’s guide rather than just a list.
- **All-in-One Prompt:** By leveraging the power of the AI in a single prompt, the workflow efficiently handles multiple cities at once, ensuring consistency and creativity in the output.
- **Scalable:** The workflow can be easily expanded to more cities or adapted for different types of tours (e.g., dessert tours, vegetarian tours).
